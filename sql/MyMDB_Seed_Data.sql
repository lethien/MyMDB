(1,3,3,'At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr\'s wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it\'s either going too slowly with little happening that\'s exciting or even particularly interesting, or it\'s providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there\'s no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.'),
(3,3,4,'I\'ll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.\r\n\r\nI liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level. It\'s great to see that this sequel is as good or even better than the first one.\r\n\r\nI absolutely recommend this movie, it kicks major ass.'),(2,8,4,'I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i\'ll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!\r\n\r\nActing (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!\r\n\r\nAction (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?\r\n\r\nStory(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you\'re welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!\r\n\r\nCinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange \"the magic\" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.\r\n\r\nOverall, i\'d give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn\'t THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!\r\n\r\nSome questions that my friends asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is this better than civil war?\" - Well visual-wise on par, but story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was more of a standardized origin film. \r\n\r\n\"Is there a post-credit scene?\" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two, but we got to see only 1. \r\n\r\n\"Is this the most mind-boggling thing you\'ve ever seen on screen?\" - Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I\'ve never seen before. No, nothing was so mind-blowing that it made me think different of the world or something.\r\n'),(2,7,3,'This movie is incredible. A ton of fun with brilliant action and hilarious dialogue this is another fantastic win for Marvel. Paul Rudd plays a likable and charismatic hero who really makes you root for him and his goals. Michael Pena is the real heist of this film as he steals every scene that he is in. Corey Stoll as the villain was a fantastic choice from Marvel. He can play the corporate business man and an intimidating villain. The visuals are stunning in this film. All of the tiny ant scenes are visually outstanding and hilarious. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. Ant Man is a fantastic movie which is worth your money and I suggest that you see it in cinemas.'),
(2,6,5,'I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren\'t afraid to take chances. I\'ve read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there\'s no plot. Unless you\'re mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you\'re on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.'),(2,1,4,'As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.\r\n\r\nWhile Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.\r\n\r\nThe humor works well for this film also. It\'s well-written and has a great cast.\r\n\r\nWhat impressed me the most was the CGI! They\'re breath-taking, but aren\'t distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic.'),
(2,2,4,'John Wick has a very simple, maybe even laughable plot. It is a typical guy takes his revenge movie. It can be easily summarized as \"Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes\" but the thing is you actually can see it is really Keanu who is doing it. Instead of shaky cameras and dozens of superfast cuts, you can see kick-ass long takes which are amazingly choreographed. Since this is their first film, the director duo has a few problems with storytelling but I am glad that they made me realize how much I miss watching an action movie and actually see what\'s going on.'),(2,3,4,'For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews.

However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.\r\n\r\nSamuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.\r\n\r\nAll in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.\r\n'),(2,4,2,'Sadly I had big expectations for Black Panther as a HUGE fan of Black Lightning TV show, I was looking forward to this release only to be dismayed.\r\n\r\nAt best it is a movie made with 90% green screen sequences but in reality it is a discombobulated mash of garbage that takes way too long to develop any story whatsoever and that storyline is as thin and weak as a nightclub whiskey, left stale overnight and re-poured.\r\n\r\nThe hype is over-rated and the movie is ultimately disappointing. May appeal to Millenials who exist without a functioning braincell.'),(3,5,4,'\'Avengers Assemble\' (\'The Avengers\') is a truly enjoyable superhero film that lives up to its hype and creates a story that allows for four of the greatest superheroes to connect in this mega-blockbuster extravaganza. Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki\'s army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie. An impressive and remarkable fantastical superhero flick from Whedon.');

It\'s a new gen story about what friendships mean in today\'s world, given the fact that the world has become much smaller and vastly connected by technology and social media. I loved the fact that sometimes letting go is hard and it can manifest itself in the form of insecurity. The solution? Create a purpose for yourself, have the courage to bid a heartfelt goodbye and make a new circle of near and dear ones. This movie made me feel much more mature and it felt as if I have watched Disney grow from an innocuous child in the 90s to a grown-up in 2018. I already feel that I have grown along with it. This movie is a gem and I really liked it. Please go to your nearby theaters to watch it! P.S.

Michael bay was in it for the money but this one this one is better it focus on the story, now I heard they are making or going to make a best wars well that would be dumb and the animated of cybertron will be really stupid I think that travis were he did a short look of cybertron I think he did amazing that\'s what it needs to look like and it made me feel like I was playing war for cybertron it was very well planned and thought of, I love it so I hope this gets out to everyone about this movie bumblebee and I hope they see this because this might actually get everyone (credits and people as in fans they lost to come back) to come back instead of having a transformer series scattered like how bay did. Maybe travis needs to press the button as in the reset button for this series of movies. I believe he is the answer to all there problems and to get people to come back. I love his movie I never left a comment on none of bays but I just found him out and boy he did great. And all the people that thinks tr hey have it all right maybe ya\'ll need to watch it over and over and over and also have a son that watches it 24/7 he knows there names by heart so I say that this has been by far the biggest greatest transformer movie ever I just hope and pray that they press the reboot button and make it how it needs to be with travis he knows what\'s right and the g1 version at the beginning that\'s what they need to work on it was OUTSTANDING SO NO ANIME VERSIONS OR BEAST WARS I love what travis did and this is absolutely my first time I ever commented on this stuff I never liked Bay\'s version'),
(7, 12, 3, 'I think itâ€™s safe to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Jared Leto plays an amazing joker and even cut his hair and shaved his eyebrows for the role. I really like Harley Quinn as well. She seemed to be the comedic relief (at least to me). The rest of the characters, besides Deadshot, Joker, and Harley Quinn were kinda unimportant. I did like how they showed the â€œvillainsâ€ (if you dare to even call some of them that ) backstorys. It also went deeper into Harley Quinn and Jokerâ€™s relationship. Very interesting. Overall I liked this movie and think you should give it a shot. It also had a really good soundtrack including Heathens by Twenty Ã˜ne PilÃ¸ts.'),
(8, 13, 2, 'This movie is the best Disney movie there is in my book. The story is so heartfelt and emotional, im sure lots of adults even cried their first time watching as well. (SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE CLICK AWAY) The plot does a great job with keeping its watchers on their toes. For example, we all knew Scar, the jealous brother, was not very fond of Mufasa, but im sure no one was expecting for him killing him own brother. WOW!  Then, he even convinces Simba that it was his fault. The most emotional scene in my opinion would have to be when Scar kills his brother, and you see simba desperately trying to wake his father even though, deep down, he knows things are never gonna be the same in his world.'),

Unfortunately, she also noticed a marked resemblance between Ursula the Sea Witch and her grandmother!

(9, 14, 4, 'Finally a femal heroine that kniws what she whants and not afraid to fight for what she believe in but most of all the animation and music are spectacular'),
(7, 15, 5, 'Frozen is the best movie I ve ever seen. Elsa stays in fear in her childhood  days.  But her secret was revealed  and showed  evil in her after reaching  the  mountains.  Her Castle was extremely  gorgeous  made of ice. She played  the role of both heroine  and villain.  Her fight with Hans showed girl power. The last seen act of true love that elsa shared with Anna was a really  Memorable  seen.  And everybody  lived happily ever.  She was really  very brave and she chose the right way at last'),
(7, 14, 5, 'i loved this since i was a child i love it now too <3 its the best version of mermaid tails eve'),
(7, 17, 4, 'The best superhero tales are those which bring out the hero part of the character rather than the super part and Thor is one of them. The film tells a character change in a poetic manner along with a great OST by Patrick Doyle and good acting performances delivered by the entire cast.');
